# Wink Web

Wink Web is a responsive web based dashboard for controlling the wink home automation platform.

  - it used javascript for majority of the functionality
  - it can be run without the need of a php server
  - it keeps login credentials stored locally as opposed to on a server


Wink web also comes bundled with an xcode project and a Mac OS X 10.11 or El Capitan Application for quick access to Wink Web
